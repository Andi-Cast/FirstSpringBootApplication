# **First Spring Boot Application**
### This is my first attempt at experimenting with Spring Boot and using APIs. I also go the chance to test my code with Postman.
-----
## **Application Details**
- As this being my first attempt at working with and building a Spring Boot application, I got the opportunity to work new technologies and learn a bit about the structure of APIs.
- This served as a learning experience for and getting familiar the tools in order to create a web application.
- This application had three layers that consisted of the API, Service and Data Access Layer.
- In order to implement functionality I used a Member class to test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE http request.
  - I used Postman to test these requests.
- I used PostgreSQL as my database of choice to store the instances of my Member examples.
- I would like to give credit to AmigosCode YouTube videos for guiding me in understanding Spring Boot.
